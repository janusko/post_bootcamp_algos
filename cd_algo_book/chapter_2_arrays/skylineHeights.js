// You are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings in the city. For example, ​[-1,7,3]​ would represent three buildings: first is actually below street level, second is seven stories high, and third is three stories high (but hidden behind the seven-story one). You are situated at street level. Return an array containing heights of the buildings you can see, in order. Given ​[1,-1,7,3]​ return ​[1,7]​.
